Needed to fix these things:

create _config/defaults/sidebar_layout.yml
  there is a pull request pending for this.

fix the deep_merge in lib/octopress/configuration.rb
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Deep in the jekyll/marku logic the markup for code blocks is getting
screwed up.  It is sooo hard to figure out where it pulls its template from.

in ~/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p194/gems/jekyll-0.12.0/lib/jekyll/site.rb is 
Site::render, which calls post.render(self.layouts, payload)
and we know that the formatting happens in that stack.

Also we know that within post.render
is called do_layout, and the expansion is done BEFORE that.

GAAHHH this is the solution:
       rm .pygments-cache/*
