Manufacturers
-------------

I am aware of three companies manufacturing compatible motors.  All appear to
produce a good-quality product.

### Switec {{< img "/resources/2012-05-25/x25-168.jpg" right >}}
Switec was originally the technology arm of the Swiss watch company Swatch.
The stepper business was sold off to Singapore-based [Juken Technology](http://jukenswisstech.com/) in 2009.
Switec motors are white, and have part numbers starting with "X".

###VID {{< img "/resources/2012-05-25/vid29-02.jpg" right >}}
Hong Kong based [VID](http://www.vid.wellgain.com/product.aspx) also manufacture a range
of similar motors.  Their motors are black, and have a black model number starting with "vid".

###MCR {{< img "/resources/2012-05-25/mr1108.jpg" right >}} 
Chinese company [MCR Motor](http://www.mcrmotor.com/en/) manufacture a range of compatible motors.
Their motors are white. with part numbers starting with "MR".

Other Switec Series
------

### X23 Series
The X23 motors have an a hollow metal shaft encasing a transparent light guide
to make it possible to have an illuminated pointer.

### X26 Series
The X26 motors are dual-shaft analog clock motors.  The model numbers are X26.101, X26.103, X26.123, X26.504.
See the the "Switec Series Buyers Guide" in the [Resources](/resources) for more details.

### X27 Series
The X27 motors are a new line replacing the X25 series.  The X27 part numbers mirror the X25 series.

### X12 Motor Drivers
The X12 part numbers refer to a series of driver chips developed by Switec.  I have not been able to
locate a supplier of these chips since microcomponents.ch shut down.


Suppliers
---------

I have not found any well-known online store supplying these parts.
They are cheap and plentiful on ebay.  However it can
be difficult to determine exactly what you are getting; these motors are generally
sold as Switec X25 _replacements_, without clearly specifying the manufacturer.
