[OpenXC](http://openxcplatform.com/) is a very cool initiative involving Ford Motor Company
and Bug Labs aimed at creating an open development ecosystem for interfacing with in-car electronics.
Looks like a pretty great project.

OpenXC Switec X25-based "Retro Gauge"
-------------------------------------

{{< img src="/resources/2013-03-03/overview.jpg" pos="right" >}}
One of the OpenXC projects featured on their website is a
[retro gauge](http://openxcplatform.com/projects/retro-gauge.html)
based around Switec X25 type micro-steppers.

They have published Eagle schematics for a gorgeous little combination
analog/digital instrument gauge.  Their in-gauge PCB cleverly incorporates
an Arduino Pro Mini.  They have also published STL files for a 3D-printable housing.  
This all looks very slick to me.

Their firmware uses our very own [Switec X25 library](https://github.com/clearwater/SwitecX25).

You can find detailed documentation and resources at
their [github repository](https://github.com/openxc/retro-gauge).
