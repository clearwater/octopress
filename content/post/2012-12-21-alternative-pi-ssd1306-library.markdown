The SSD1306 code in the [py-gaugette library](https://github.com/guyc/py-gaugette) has been
modified at [andig/AdaPi](https://github.com/andig/AdaPi) with several
extensions including I&sup2;C support, and the addition of geometric drawing functions from
[Adafruit's GFX Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library).
If you need to drive the I&sup2;C version of this display from a RPi,
this is the place to start.
