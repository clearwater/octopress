Phil Bambridge has blogged about
his [Beverage-o-Meter](http://pmb.neongrit.net/blog/?p=116)
which demonstrates wireless remote control of an analog gauge using Arduinos eqipped with Nordic 2.4GHz radio boards.
Fun, whimsical, and beautifully housed too.  His project uses a Switec stepper for the gauge, and
uses the [SwitecX25](https://github.com/clearwater/SwitecX25) library.
Check out his blog and source code [here](http://pmb.neongrit.net/blog/?p=116).
