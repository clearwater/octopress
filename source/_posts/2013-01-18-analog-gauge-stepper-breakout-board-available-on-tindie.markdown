Check out this great new [Tindie project](https://tindie.com/shops/TheRengineer/analog-gauge-stepper-breakout-board/)
launched by [The Renaissance Engineer](http://www.therengineer.com/) [Adam Fabio](https://twitter.com/ajfabio)
for a new breakout board designed for Switec motors and clones.

The breakout board incorporates flyback diodes to protect your circuit from inductive kickback, and
the also serves as a convenient base to mount the motors.  The kit includes
the board, diodes, 6-pin header, a Switec X27.168 and 3d-printed needle.

If you want to get in on this initial offering act quickly - it closes
in 12 days.  The project has already exceeded the funding target.
Nice work Adam!
