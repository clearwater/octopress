I've now added the backlight to the second gauge
in this build.  This time I was able to get the resistor tucked up nicely out
the way so it wont cast a shadow.
A nice helping of hot-glue holds everything in place.

These photos show the LEDs at 100% brightness, but they are
on PWM pins so I can control the intensity from the Arduino code.

It is subtle, but in the next photo you
can detect the shadow of the resistor
in the right-most guage - a dark spot between 30 and 40.
It's fine, and the light spread isn't that even anyway,
so I'm going to call it character.

The box is made from salvaged hardwood fence pickets.  I think
it's red stringybark, very hard and with nice colour and
grain definition.

I'll wire the 3-position switch to the arduino; maybe off, on, and
on-with-backlight.  Still need to do some final treatment to the wood, and
mount this thing.  Almost done.
