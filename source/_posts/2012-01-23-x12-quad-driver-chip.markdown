The [X25 data sheet](/resources/switec/X25_xxx_01_SP_E-1.pdf)
describes the X12 family of driver chips which allow
up to 4 Switec motors to be controlled over a 3-wire serial interface.
I like the look of these for keeping the I/O count down, and offloading
a bunch of processing from the Arduino.

However I have been unable to find a supplier for X12 quad driver chips.
It seems that they were available until recently
from Swatch subsidiary Microcomponents Ltd. at microcomponents.ch,
but after Swatch 
[sold the stepping motor business](http://www.swatchgroup.com/en/services/archive/2009/swatch_group_sale_of_microcomponents_automotive_business_activities_to_juken_technology)
to Singapore-based [Juken Techonology](http://www.jukenswisstech.com) in 2009, 
that website disappeared.
