I made dial faces for a couple of the square gauges built
in [Build Number One](/blog/2012/01/28/build-number-one/).  Nearly
ready to install these guys.  

I wrote a ruby script to generate the line-work for the dial face
so I could position the lines precisely.
I started with the gd2 bindings, but gd2 doesn't
seem to support anti-aliasing or linecaps and the linework
was pretty ugly.  I switched to Cairo which did a much nicer 
job.  I used OpenOffice to position the text labels.

I found some paper with a slightly metallic / opalesque finish at the
OfficeWorks in Cairns which I thought would make a nice finish.
It is 120 gsm which is heavier than standard typing paper, but
really not really stiff enough to support itself in the gauge
so I've just laid it over the original dial plate.

One thing that had me stuffed is how to punch a neat hole in the paper for
the drive shaft.  A standard hole-punch is too big and can't reach 
far from the edge of the paper.  Drilling would leave messy edges.  Scouring
the aisles at OfficeWorks I found a 
[set of three eyelette setters by Fiskar](http://www.fiskarscraft.eu/Products/Craft/Punches/Eyelet-Setter/Eyelet-Setter-Pack), apparently for scrap-booking.  The hole punches use a crazy spring-driven hammer mechanism, so you can position them anywhere on the page.  I was looking to punch a 3mm hole, and the middle
size is 3.2mm (1/8").  The downside is the set of 3 cost about $25.  Anyway they work a treat and now I have some crafty hole punches.

I tried printing the dials with an inkjet.  That
looked okay until I mounted it in the guage and I found
that at certain angles the metallic finish
on the paper made the linework look really washed out.  Redoing
the printing with a laser printer gave much better results.
