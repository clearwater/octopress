What is Gaugette?
-----------------

{% img right /resources/thermo_backlit.png LED Backlighting %}
Gaugette is a project detailing the construction of custom analog gauges using
an Arduino microcontroller and Switec X25 stepper motors.

What is a Switec X25?
---------------------
I've chosen Switec X25.168 miniature
stepper motors to drive the gauges.  These steppers
were developed by Switec, the Swatch Company's technology arm,
for automobile instrument clusters. They are really cheap, readily available
and require no external driver circuitry.  Pretty cool huh?

Because information about driving these motors with the Arduino is hard to find,
I've gathered the datasheets and other [resources here](/resources), 
and have published a
[Arduino SwitecX25 driver library](https://github.com/clearwater/SwitecX25)
on GitHub.
